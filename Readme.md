## brief intro

Makefile and their utils modified from Lupei Zhu's Makefile for Receiver Function processing.

## Initiate

Initiation of this project is my great pain reading old scripts due to the poorly readable management, and their reliance on specific file management or header settings.

This project rewrite part of the scripts thus robustness is partially strengthened.

## Requirements

SAC: sac file processing and recheck,
TauP: cal arrival time, ray constant.

## Installing

export `util/perls` and `util/bin` to your PATH

## notes

1. modified help info in `iter_decon.c`. Its former example code cannot run since options has changes over versions.
